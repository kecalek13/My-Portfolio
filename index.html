                    Hi, I'm Tomáš Langer, a developer from the Czech Republic. I'm 12 years old and I'm interested in programming, it's my hobby. I'm currently learing Java. Also I'm interested in web development, game development and cyber security. 
                    
                    <br><br>For game development I'm usually using Godot. But I also want to learn Unity, because it's very popular and it has lots of features. I like to learn 3D game development, because I can create beautiful games. I'm also interested in 2D games, because they are easier to create and 2D games can be also very fun. I also tried to make a game in Roblox Studio, becase it's very easy to use and the game can be pblished free and very easily.
                    
                    <br><br>For web development I'm using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm always using VSCODE for web development. In the field of web development, I am mainly a frontend developer, but I also want to learn backend because I will need it in my career. Web development is my favourite, because I can create lots of useful websites and web apps for other people and also myself.
                    
                    <br><br>In cyber security I'm learning, how to potect myself from hackers and also how to hack. For hacking I'm using OS Kali Linux as a Virtual Machine (btw for virtualization I use Virtual Box). It has lots of tools for hacking and cyber security. 
                    
                    <br><br>Web development, game development and cyber security are very interesting things, but I also like to play games and I like math and physics, because it's very interesting and useful. Overall, I enjoy to learn new things. &#128516;
