                    Hi, I'm Tomáš Langer, a developer from the Czech Republic. I'm 12 years old and I'm interested in programming, it's my hobby. I'm currently learing Java. Also I'm interested in web development, game development and cyber security. For game development I'm usually sing Godot and for web development I'm using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm always using VSCODE for web development. In cyber security I'm learning, how to potect myself from hackers and also how to hack. For hacking I'm using OS Kali Linux. It has lots of tools for hacking and cyber security. Web development is my favourite, because I can create lots of useful websites and web apps for other people and also myself. Web development, game development and cyber security are very interesting things, but I also like to play games and I like math and physics, because it's very interesting and useful. Overall, I enjoy to learn new things &#128516;
